### Who am I?

I was born in the UK, but have lived almost my whole life in New Zealand, so am definitely a Kiwi at heart!

I have a degree in Software Engineering, and my goal is to grow in this field while continuously learning and expanding my skillset. I love working in this field - it's full of rewarding challenges and growth opportunities!

When I'm not at my computer, I am usually behind a camera. I have been successfully running my own photography business for a few years now, and this presents it's own challenges while being a fantastic creative outlet.

My other hobbies include weightlifting and reading, and I have recently started trying my hand at running also.
